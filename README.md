🎯 Project Objective

Eliminate fake certificates and document fraud

Replace manual verification processes

Provide tamper-proof document authentication

Demonstrate blockchain-based trust systems

Build a hackathon-ready Web3 solution

🏗 How It Works

User uploads a document

System generates SHA-256 hash

Hash + timestamp stored in simulated blockchain

User re-uploads file to verify

System compares hashes

Displays:

✅ Document Authentic

❌ Document Tampered

📌 Note

This is a frontend-only prototype

Blockchain integration is simulated

No backend or database used

Built for hackathon demonstration

🔮 Future Scope

Ethereum / Polygon smart contract integration

IPFS decentralized file storage

MetaMask wallet authentication

QR-code based verification

AI-powered fraud detection

Multi-chain compatibility
